    of lateral, top and bottom strips by thresholding the mean pixel value

    If calibV is not zero, then 2 mm are removed from the top of I (this 
    program assumes that it corresponds to the skin location).
    
    Args:
        I (array): grayscale or RGB image (the function will convert it to 
        grayscale image if it has not yet been done)
        threshCmin (double): between 0. and 255., minimum threshold value 
        for the lateral strips

        threshRmax (double): between 0. and 255., maximum threshold value 
        for the bottom and top strips
        calibV (double): vertical calibration factor. Default value is 0.
        If calibV is different from 0, then the equivalent of 2mm is
        cropped at the top of I to remove skin from the image.

    Returns:
        I2 (array): same dimension as I, containing only the region of interest
