def autocropping(I, threshCmin, threshCmax, threshRmin, threshRmax, calibV = 0, additionalCrop1 = 0, additionalCrop2 = 0):
    """ Cropping of raw ultrasound image I to get region of interest: Removal 
    of lateral, top and bottom strips by thresholding the mean pixel value 
    of raws and columns.
    If calibV is not zero, then 'additionalCrop1' millimeters are removed from 
    the top of I (for example to remove the skin, additionalCrop1 should be around
    2mm), and 'additionalCrop2' millimeters are removed from the bottom.
    15 pixels are removed from the right border to make the white vertical
    line disappear.
    
    Args:
        I (array): grayscale or RGB image (the function will convert it to 
        grayscale image if it has not yet been done)
        threshCmin (double): between 0. and 255., minimum threshold value 
        for the lateral strips
        threshCmax (double): between 0. and 255., maximum threshold value 
        for the lateral strips
        threshRmin (double): between 0. and 255., minimum threshold value 
        for the bottom and top strips
        threshRmax (double): between 0. and 255., maximum threshold value 
        for the bottom and top strips
        calibV (double): vertical calibration factor. Default value is 0.
        If calibV is different from 0, then the equivalent of 'additionalCrop1'
        mm is cropped at the top of I to remove skin from the image, and 
        'additionalCrop2' mm are removed from the bottom.
        additionalCrop1, additionalCrop2 (floats): in millimeters, value to
        remove from top and bottom respectively, in addition to the first
        automatic cropping


    Returns:
        I2 (array): same dimension as I, containing only the region of interest
